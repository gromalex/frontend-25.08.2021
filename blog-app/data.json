In most cases, this means that an element with position: relative; that contains a link with the .stretched-link class is clickable. Please note given how CSS position works, .stretched-link cannot be mixed with most table elements.\r\n\r\nCards have position: relative by default in Bootstrap, so in this case you can safely add the .stretched-link class to a link in the card without any other HTML changes.\r\n\r\nMultiple links and tap targets are not recommended with stretched links. However, some position and z-index styles can help should this be required."}]}
